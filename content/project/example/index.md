Project Leaders: Prof. Lin Liu and Prof. Suhong Zhou
This project is a sub-project of the National Key R&D Program “Construction of Urban Public Safety Stereo Network and Demonstration of Emergency Response” (CUPSSNDER), which is funded by the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology. Total Funding: ￥23,000,000 (about £ 2,626,830). 
Background
The traditional method of measuring neighborhood-level fear of crime is to use questionnaires, but the questionnaires may not cover all neighborhoods. Our approach aims to use multi-source big data for deriving detailed neighborhood environment characteristics. Using machine learning methods, the relationship between neighborhood characteristics and neighborhood safety perception can be established.
Role in the project
I am a key member in this project. I participated in the application and implementation for this project. Based on this project, I published two peer-reviewed paper and developed a patent.

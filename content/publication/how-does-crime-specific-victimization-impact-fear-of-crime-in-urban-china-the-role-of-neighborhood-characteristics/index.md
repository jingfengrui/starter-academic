  Past research has failed to find consistent relationships between criminal
  victimization and fear of crime. Except for neighborhood disorder and crime
  rate, few studies have examined whether other neighborhood conditions matter
  the victimization—fear relationship. Using survey data in Guangzhou
  neighborhoods, the present analysis employs multinomial logistic regression
  models to examine whether neighborhood characteristics moderate the
  relationship between violent victimization and fear of violence, and between
  burglary victimization and fear of burglary, separately. Some aspects of the
  neighborhood environment do differentially influence victims’ and

  non-victims’ fear levels. Besides verifying the interaction effect of neighborhood disorder and victimization, the present study finds that neighborhood policing alleviates the harmful effect of violent victimization on fear, while collective efficacy fosters the harmful effect of burglary victimization on fear. This paper underscores the significance of the social context of urban China in explaining the interplay of neighborhood characteristics and victimization on fear of crime.

  Abstract：Tourism resource attraction can reflect the characteristics of urban
  tourism spatial

  structure characteristics. Taking Chengdu as an example，we establish a tourism resource attraction

  evaluation system based on multivariate data，and evaluate the attraction of its tourism resources.

  We discuss the characteristics of tourism attraction spatial structure and reveal influencing factors

  via kernel density estimation and spatial autocorrelation. Some suggestions are proposed for

  optimizing the tourism spatial structure in Chengdu from the perspective of tourism attraction. We

  found that the overall tourism attraction pattern in Chengdu follows the city center > whole city >

  rest of the city，and there are obvious differences between different tourism resources. Tourism

  attraction density is uneven；the main urban area and Dujiangyan are high- value regions while

  other places are opposite. There are spatial agglomeration phenomena between different tourism

  resource points and different districts. Tourism resource attraction is significantly related with

  regional population density，resource density and other factors. According to our results we put

  forward some suggestions for tourism resource development in Chengdu across two aspects：coreperiphery

  geographical theory and growth pole theory. Suggestions are simple but practical. First，

  related management organization ought to develop new natural，human and leisure tourism

  resources with high quality in densely populated areas because population factors are a key index

  that influences regional tourism resource attraction. Second，in order to improve agglomeration

  effects and achieve centralized development，it would be better to increase the density of tourism

  resources in some areas. Third，related organizations are supposed to develop new centers of

  tourism resource attraction. New attraction centers have improved effects on local economies，

  culture，environment and infrastructure.

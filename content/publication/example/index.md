abstract: Previous literature has examined the relationship between the amount
  of green space and perceived safety in urban areas, but little is known about
  the effect of street-view neighborhood greenery on perceived neighborhood
  safety. Using a deep learning approach, we derived greenery from a massive set
  of street view images in central Guangzhou. We further tested the
  relationships and mechanisms between street-view greenery and fear of crime in
  the neighbor-hood. Results demonstrated that a higher level of neighborhood
  street-view greenery was associated with a lower fear of crime, and its
  relationship was mediated by perceived physical incivilities. While increasing
  street greenery of the micro-environment may reduce fear of crime, this paper
  also suggests that social factors should be considered when designing
  ameliorative programs.
